  When lazy sequences are produced via functions that have side
  effects, any effects other than those needed to produce the first
  element in the seq do not occur until the seq is consumed. dorun can
  be used to force any effects. Walks through the successive nexts of
  the seq, does not retain the head and returns nil.
