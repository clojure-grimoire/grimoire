  print nested objects. If it is bound to logical false, there is no

  level to print. Each argument to print is at level 0; if an argument is a
  collection, its items are at level 1; and so on. If an object is a
  collection and is at a level greater than or equal to the value bound to
  *print-level*, the printer prints '#' to represent it. The root binding
