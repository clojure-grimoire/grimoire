(defn deref
  "Also reader macro: @ref/@agent/@var/@atom/@delay/@future/@promise. Within a transaction,
  returns the in-transaction-value of ref, else returns the
  most-recently-committed value of ref. When applied to a var, agent
  or atom, returns its current state. When applied to a delay, forces
  it if not already forced. When applied to a future, will block if
  computation not complete. When applied to a promise, will block
  until a value is delivered.  The variant taking a timeout can be
  used for blocking references (futures and promises), and will return
  timeout-val if the timeout (in milliseconds) is reached before a
  value is available. See also - realized?."
