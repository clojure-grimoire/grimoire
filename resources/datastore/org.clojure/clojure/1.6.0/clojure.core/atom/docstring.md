  Creates and returns an Atom with an initial value of x and zero or
  more options (in any order):

  :meta metadata-map

  :validator validate-fn

  If metadata-map is supplied, it will become the metadata on the
  atom. validate-fn must be nil or a side-effect-free fn of one
  argument, which will be passed the intended new state on any state
  change. If the new state is unacceptable, the validate-fn should
  return false or throw an exception.
