  Checks multiple assertions with a template expression.
  See clojure.template/do-template for an explanation of
  templates.

  Example: (are [x y] (= x y)  
                2 (+ 1 1)
                4 (* 2 2))
  Expands to: 
           (do (is (= 2 (+ 1 1)))
               (is (= 4 (* 2 2))))

  Note: This breaks some reporting features, such as line numbers.
