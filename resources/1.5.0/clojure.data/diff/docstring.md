  Recursively compares a and b, returning a tuple of
  [things-only-in-a things-only-in-b things-in-both].
  Comparison rules:

  * For equal a and b, return [nil nil a].
  * Maps are subdiffed where keys match and values differ.
  * Sets are never subdiffed.
  * All sequential things are treated as associative collections
    by their indexes, with results returned as vectors.
  * Everything else (including strings!) is treated as
    an atom and compared for equality.
