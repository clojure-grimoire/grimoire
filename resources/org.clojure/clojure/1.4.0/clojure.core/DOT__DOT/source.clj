(defmacro ..
  "form => fieldName-symbol or (instanceMethodName-symbol args*)

  Expands into a member access (.) of the first member on the first
  argument, followed by the next member on the result, etc. For
  instance:

  (.. System (getProperties) (get \"os.name\"))

  expands to:

  (. (. System (getProperties)) (get \"os.name\"))

  but is easier to write, read, and understand."
