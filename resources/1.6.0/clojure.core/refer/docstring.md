  refers to all public vars of ns, subject to filters.
  filters can include at most one each of:

  :exclude list-of-symbols
  :only list-of-symbols
  :rename map-of-fromsymbol-tosymbol

  For each public interned var in the namespace named by the symbol,
  adds a mapping from the name of the var to the var to the current
  namespace.  Throws an exception if name is already mapped to
  something else in the current namespace. Filters can be used to
  select a subset, via inclusion or exclusion, or to provide a mapping
  to a symbol different from the var's name, in order to prevent
  clashes. Use :use in the ns macro in preference to calling this directly.
