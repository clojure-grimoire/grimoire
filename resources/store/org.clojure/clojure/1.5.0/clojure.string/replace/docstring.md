  Replaces all instance of match with replacement in s.

   match/replacement can be:

   string / string
   char / char
   pattern / (string or function of match).

   See also replace-first.

   The replacement is literal (i.e. none of its characters are treated
   specially) for all cases above except pattern / string.

   For pattern / string, $1, $2, etc. in the replacement string are
   substituted with the string that matched the corresponding
   parenthesized group in the pattern.  If you wish your replacement
   string r to be used literally, use (re-quote-replacement r) as the
   replacement argument.  See also documentation for
   java.util.regex.Matcher's appendReplacement method.

   Example:
   (clojure.string/replace "Almost Pig Latin" #"\b(\w)(\w+)\b" "$2$1ay")
   -> "lmostAay igPay atinLay"
