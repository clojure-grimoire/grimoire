  transaction-flags => TBD, pass nil for now

  Runs the exprs (in an implicit do) in a transaction that encompasses
  exprs and any nested calls.  Starts a transaction if none is already
  running on this thread. Any uncaught exception will abort the
  transaction and flow out of sync. The exprs may be run more than
  once, but any effects on Refs will be atomic.
