  Defines a test function with no arguments.  Test functions may call
  other tests, so tests may be composed.  If you compose tests, you
  should also define a function named test-ns-hook; run-tests will
  call test-ns-hook instead of testing all vars.

  Note: Actually, the test body goes in the :test metadata on the var,
  and the real function (the value of the var) calls test-var on
  itself.

  When *load-tests* is false, deftest is ignored.
