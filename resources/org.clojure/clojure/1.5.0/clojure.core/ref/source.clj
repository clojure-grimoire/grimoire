(defn ref
  "Creates and returns a Ref with an initial value of x and zero or
  more options (in any order):

  :meta metadata-map

  :validator validate-fn

  :min-history (default 0)
  :max-history (default 10)

  If metadata-map is supplied, it will become the metadata on the
  ref. validate-fn must be nil or a side-effect-free fn of one
  argument, which will be passed the intended new state on any state
  change. If the new state is unacceptable, the validate-fn should
  return false or throw an exception. validate-fn will be called on
  transaction commit, when all refs have their final values.

  Normally refs accumulate history dynamically as needed to deal with
  read demands. If you know in advance you will need history you can
  set :min-history to ensure it will be available when first needed (instead
  of after a read fault). History is limited, and the limit can be set
  with :max-history."
