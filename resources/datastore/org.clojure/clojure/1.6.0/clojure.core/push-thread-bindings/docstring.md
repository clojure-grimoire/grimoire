  WARNING: This is a low-level function. Prefer high-level macros like
  binding where ever possible.

  Takes a map of Var/value pairs. Binds each Var to the associated value for
  the current thread. Each call *MUST* be accompanied by a matching call to
  pop-thread-bindings wrapped in a try-finally!
  
      (push-thread-bindings bindings)
      (try
        ...
        (finally
          (pop-thread-bindings)))
